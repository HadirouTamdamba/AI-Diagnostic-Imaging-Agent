An advanced AI-powered medical imaging analysis tool built with Streamlit and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model. This application addresses the critical challenge of providing rapid, accurate, and accessible medical image interpretation to bridge the gap between complex diagnostic imaging and clinical decision-making.

## üéØ Problem Statement & Solution

### The Challenge
Modern healthcare faces significant challenges in medical imaging interpretation:

- **Diagnostic Bottlenecks**: Radiologists are overwhelmed with increasing imaging volumes, leading to delayed diagnoses
- **Accessibility Gap**: Limited access to specialized radiology expertise in remote or underserved areas
- **Educational Barriers**: Complex medical terminology makes it difficult for patients to understand their diagnostic results
- **Consistency Issues**: Human interpretation variability can affect diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility
- **Time Constraints**: Emergency cases require rapid initial assessment to guide immediate clinical decisions
